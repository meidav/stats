Database Migration Script: Add date_played field and rename existing date field logic

This script:
1. Adds a new 'date_played' field to all game tables
2. Copies existing 'game_date' to 'date_played' 
3. Updates the schema to properly track when game was played vs edited
4. Handles all game types: games, vollis_games, one_v_one_games, other_games
